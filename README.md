# Vema Dev Toolkit

Simple app, that includes some useful generators when working on the frontend.

## Live demo
https://vema-dev.github.io/toolkit/www/

## Install Dependencies

First of all we need to install dependencies, run in terminal
```
npm install
```

## NPM Scripts

* ðŸ”¥ `start` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `dev` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `build` - build web app for production

Colors - an extended color picker, the selected value is converted into hex, rgba, hsla and hsb. The tint and shade of the selected color are also created - useful for hover, for example.

CSS - a shadow and gradient generator

Other - currently only an ID generator

Over time, the application will be expanded with additional functionalities, such as regexp tester, button and card generator.

The www folder was generated for the needs of the live demo :)

Each module was written at a different time, hence the differences in the code. Someday the code will become unified.
